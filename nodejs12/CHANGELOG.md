# IBM Functions NodeJS 12 Runtime Container

## Migrating from `nodejs:10` to `nodejs:12`
  - The ibm-watson sdk version moved to 6.x. It includes a number of breaking changes. See https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk/blob/HEAD/MIGRATION-V6.md for details.
  - The `ibmiotf` package is renamed to `@wiotp/sdk`. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wiotp/sdk for all changes.
  - The `request` package is deprecated and therefore not available in this runtime.
